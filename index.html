<h3>What is Voice Chat?</h3>
<p>
Voice Chat provides real-time voice conversation with AI powered by Grok's speech API. Available in both Chat LLM and LLM Pro. 
You can choose from 5 different voices and enjoy unlimited continuous responses without time limits. Voice conversations 
are automatically transcribed and saved for reference. Voice Chat requires an xAI API key from <a href="https://x.ai" target="_blank">x.ai</a>.
</p>
<h3>How is my data handled?</h3>
<p>
<strong>Chat LLM - Local Model:</strong> When using the built-in local model, all conversations remain on your device.
No data is transmitted anywhere, and the app works completely offline.<br><br>
<strong>Both Apps - Cloud Inference:</strong> When using free cloud inference options, your messages are sent to our backend 
server which forwards them to the AI provider. We do not store your conversations.<br><br>
<strong>LLM Pro - Premium Subscription:</strong> When using premium subscription models, your messages are processed through 
our Groq backend. We do not store your conversations.<br><br>
<strong>Both Apps - Voice Chat:</strong> When using voice chat, your voice input and conversations are sent directly to xAI (Grok). 
Neither app stores your voice data or transcripts on our servers.<br><br>
<strong>Both Apps - Cloud Models (BYOK):</strong> When using cloud models with your own API keys, your prompts, images,
and documents are sent directly to the AI provider you selected (OpenRouter, OpenAI, or xAI). Neither app stores 
your prompts or uploads on our servers. For details on how cloud providers handle data, please refer to their privacy policies.
</p>
<h3>Can I use the app offline?</h3>
<p>
<strong>Chat LLM:</strong> Yes, the built-in local model works completely offline with no internet connection required.
Cloud inference, voice chat, and cloud models with API keys require an internet connection.<br><br>
<strong>LLM Pro:</strong> No, all features require an internet connection as the app operates exclusively via cloud-based APIs.
</p>
<h3>Why can't I upload images or documents?</h3>
<p>
Image uploads are only available when using vision-capable models in either app. 
The free cloud model (Llama 3.1 8B) and voice chat support text-only conversations. Chat LLM's local model is also text-only.
</p>
<h3>What is the LLM Pro subscription?</h3>
<p>
LLM Pro offers a premium subscription at £9.99 per month, providing access to 8 curated high-performance AI models. 
Four models include real-time web search capabilities. When using reasoning-capable models (available through subscription 
or via OpenRouter/OpenAI BYOK), the thinking box displays the AI's reasoning and research process in real-time. Subscription is 
managed through Apple's App Store and can be cancelled at any time from your device settings.
</p>
<h3>What devices are supported?</h3>
<p>
Both Chat LLM and LLM Pro are universal apps optimized for iPhone and iPad running iOS 18.0 or later.
</p>
<h3>How do I report a bug?</h3>
