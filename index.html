<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>What is Chat LLM?</h3>
<p>
Chat LLM is a flexible AI chat client that lets you talk to a wide range of text and vision models
via providers such as OpenRouter and OpenAI. You can send text prompts, images, and documents and receive
AI-generated responses.
</p>

<h3>Do I need an account?</h3>
<p>
Chat LLM itself does not create an account, but you will need your own API keys from
providers such as OpenRouter or OpenAI. Using those services requires an account with them.
</p>

<h3>Is there a subscription?</h3>
<p>
No. Chat LLM offers a 14-day free trial and a one-time purchase for lifetime access to the app
and future updates. Usage of third-party AI services may still incur costs through your chosen provider.
</p>

<h3>What models are supported?</h3>
<p>
Chat LLM supports a wide range of OpenRouter and OpenAI models, including text-only and
vision-capable models. Some model types that generate images or video directly are not currently supported.
</p>

<h3>How is my data handled?</h3>
<p>
Your text, images, and documents are sent securely to AI providers (such as OpenRouter/OpenAI) to generate responses.
Chat LLM does not store your prompts or uploads. For details on how those providers handle data,
please refer to their privacy policies.
</p>

<h3>How do I report a bug?</h3>
<p>
Please send an email describing the problem and, if possible, include screenshots or steps to reproduce it.<br>
