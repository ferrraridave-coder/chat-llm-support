<h2>1. Description of the Services</h2>

<p><strong>Chat LLM</strong> provides multiple ways to interact with AI:</p>

<p>
<strong>Built-in Local Model (Optional):</strong> Chat LLM includes an optional local AI model that runs
on your device. When using a local model, no internet connection is required and no data is sent to external servers.

This service requires an internet connection and may be subject to shared usage limits across users.

</p>

<p>
<strong>Voice Chat (Optional):</strong> Chat LLM may support real-time voice conversations using third-party providers.
This feature requires you to provide your own compatible API key (for example, xAI).

</p>

<p>
<strong>Bring Your Own API Key (Optional):</strong> Chat LLM may allow you to connect your own API keys to use
