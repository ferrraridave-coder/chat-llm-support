<h2>1. Description of the Services</h2>

<p><strong>Chat LLM</strong> provides four ways to interact with AI:</p>

<p>
<strong>Built-in Local Model:</strong> Chat LLM includes a built-in local AI model (Llama 3.2 1B) that runs 
entirely on your device and works completely offline. No account, API key, or internet connection is required 
to use the local model.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Cloud Inference:</strong> Chat LLM offers a free cloud-based AI option (Llama 3.1 8B) that does not 
require an API key. This service is subject to shared usage limits across all users and requires an internet 
connection. Cloud inference is text-only and does not support image or document uploads.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Voice Chat:</strong> Chat LLM offers real-time voice conversation powered by Grok's speech API. This 
feature requires you to provide your own xAI API key obtained from x.ai. Voice chat provides unlimited 
continuous responses without time limits and automatically saves conversation transcripts to your device. 
You are responsible for any API usage costs charged by xAI.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bring Your Own API Key:</strong> Chat LLM optionally allows you to connect your own API keys to interact 
with additional AI models provided by third-party services such as OpenRouter, OpenAI, and xAI. When using cloud models 
with your own API keys, the App sends your text, images, documents, or voice input to these providers' APIs and displays the 
responses returned. We do not operate or control the third-party models.
</p>

<p><strong>LLM Pro</strong> provides the following AI interaction options:</p>

<p>
<strong>Free Cloud Inference:</strong> LLM Pro offers a free cloud-based AI option that does not require an API key. 
This service is subject to shared usage limits across all users and requires an internet connection.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Premium Subscription:</strong> LLM Pro offers a premium subscription service (£9.99 per month) that provides 
access to 8 curated high-performance AI models: Llama 3.3 70B, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 4 Scout, Llama 4 Maverick, 
Qwen 3 32B, Kimi K2, GPT-OSS 20B, and GPT-OSS 120B. Four models (Llama 4 Scout, Llama 4 Maverick, Qwen 3 32B, 
and Kimi K2) include real-time web search capabilities. The subscription also includes a transparent thinking box 
feature that displays AI reasoning and research processes. Subscription is managed through Apple's App Store.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Voice Chat:</strong> LLM Pro offers real-time voice conversation powered by Grok's speech API. This 
feature requires you to provide your own xAI API key obtained from x.ai. You are responsible for any API usage 
costs charged by xAI.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Bring Your Own API Key:</strong> LLM Pro optionally allows you to connect your own OpenRouter, OpenAI, or xAI API 
keys to interact with additional AI models. When using cloud models with your own API keys, the App sends your text, 
images, documents, or voice input to these providers' APIs and displays the responses returned. We do not operate 
or control the third-party models.
</p>

</ul>
<p>

</p>

<h2>6. No Guarantee of AI Output</h2>
<p>
AI-generated responses from the local model, cloud inference, premium subscription models, voice chat, and cloud models with your own API keys may be inaccurate, 
incomplete, or inappropriate. We do not guarantee the correctness, reliability, or suitability of any output produced
