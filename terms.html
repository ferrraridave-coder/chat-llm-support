<h2>1. Description of the Service</h2>
<p>
Chat LLM is a client application that allows you to interact with AI models provided by
third-party services such as OpenRouter and OpenAI. The App sends your prompts, images,
and documents to these providers’ APIs and displays the responses.
We do not operate or control the models themselves.
</p>

<h2>2. User Responsibilities</h2>
<p>
You agree that you will not use the App to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Upload or generate content that is illegal, harmful, or abusive;</li>
    <li>Violate intellectual property rights or privacy rights of others;</li>
    <li>Attempt to misuse, overload, or interfere with third-party AI services;</li>
    <li>Submit sensitive personal data of others without their consent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
The App relies on APIs provided by third parties, including but not limited to OpenRouter and OpenAI.
Your use of those services is also governed by their own terms and privacy policies, which you are
responsible for reviewing:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>OpenRouter: https://openrouter.ai</li>
    <li>OpenAI: https://openai.com</li>
</ul>

<p>
We are not responsible for the availability, performance, or behaviour of these third-party services.
</p>

<h2>4. Purchases and Licensing</h2>
<p>
Chat LLM offers a one-time purchase that unlocks lifetime access to the App and future updates.
This purchase is processed through Apple’s App Store using your Apple ID. We do not store or
access your payment information.
</p>

<p>
The purchase grants you a personal, non-transferable licence to use the App on devices linked
to your Apple ID, in accordance with Apple’s terms and these Terms.
</p>

<h2>5. No Guarantee of AI Output</h2>
<p>
AI-generated content may be inaccurate, incomplete, or inappropriate. We do not guarantee
the correctness, reliability, or suitability of any output produced by third-party models.
You are responsible for verifying and using AI output at your own discretion and risk.
</p>

<h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any loss or damage arising from your reliance on AI-generated content;</li>
    <li>Service interruptions, API rate limits, or unavailability of third-party providers;</li>
    <li>Loss of data or content transmitted to third-party services;</li>
    <li>Indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Termination</h2>
<p>
We may suspend or restrict access to the App if we believe you are misusing it or violating
these Terms. You may stop using the App at any time by uninstalling it from your devices.
</p>

<h2>8. Changes to These Terms</h2>
<p>
We may update these Terms from time to time. The latest version will always be available
on this page. Continued use of the App after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance
of the updated Terms.
