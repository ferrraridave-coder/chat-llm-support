<h2>1. Built-in Local AI Model (Chat LLM Only)</h2>

<p>
Chat LLM includes an optional built-in local AI model that runs entirely on your device.
When using the local model:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>All conversations remain on your device</li>
    <li>No data is transmitted to any external servers</li>
    <li>The app can function offline</li>
    <li>No account or API key is required</li>
    <li>Prompts and responses are stored locally on your device only</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>We do not have access to any conversations you have with the local model.</strong>
This feature is only available in Chat LLM. LLM Pro operates exclusively using cloud-based services.
</p>

<h2>2. Free Cloud AI Access</h2>

<p>
Both Chat LLM and LLM Pro provide free cloud AI access without requiring an API key.
When using free cloud AI:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your text prompts are sent to our backend server</li>
    <li>Requests are forwarded to the AI provider</li>
    <li>Responses are returned to your device</li>
    <li>No account or API key is required</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>We do not store your prompts or responses.</strong>
Messages are processed in real time and discarded after delivery.
Free cloud access is text-only and does not support image or document uploads.
</p>

<h2>3. Premium Subscription (LLM Pro Only)</h2>

<p>
LLM Pro offers a premium subscription (£9.99 per month) that unlocks additional AI features.
When using premium subscription features:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your prompts and image requests are sent to supported AI providers</li>
    <li>Requests may pass through our backend server where required</li>
    <li>Responses and generated images are returned to your device</li>
    <li>Some models may retrieve up-to-date information via web search</li>
    <li>Subscriptions are managed entirely through Apple’s App Store</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>We do not store prompts, responses, or generated images.</strong>
All processing is performed in real time and data is discarded after delivery.
</p>

<h2>4. AI Image Generation (LLM Pro Only)</h2>

<p>
LLM Pro includes built-in AI image generation and image-to-image editing.
Image generation is provided via third-party AI services, including Replicate.
When using image generation:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Text prompts and optional source images are transmitted to Replicate or other supported providers</li>
    <li>Generated images are returned directly to your device</li>
    <li>Image usage limits are enforced and displayed in-app</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>We do not store image prompts or generated images on our servers.</strong>
</p>

<h2>5. Voice Chat (Optional Feature)</h2>

<p>
Both Chat LLM and LLM Pro optionally support real-time voice conversations using third-party providers.
This feature requires you to supply your own compatible API key (such as xAI).
When using voice chat:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Your voice input is transmitted directly to the selected provider</li>
    <li>Audio is processed in real time for speech recognition and response generation</li>
    <li>Conversation transcripts may be stored locally on your device</li>
    <li>Your API keys are stored only on your device</li>
</ul>

<p>
<strong>Neither app stores voice data or transcripts on our servers.</strong>
</p>

<h2>6. Bring Your Own API Key (Advanced Option)</h2>

<p>
Both apps allow you to connect your own API keys to access additional third-party AI services.
If you choose to use this feature:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Content is transmitted directly from your device to the selected provider</li>
    <li>Prompts, images, documents, and voice data are handled by that provider</li>
    <li>API keys are stored only on your device</li>
</ul>

<p>
We do not receive, store, or log content sent using your own API keys.
</p>

<h2>7. How Your Data Is Used</h2>

<p>
Neither Chat LLM nor LLM Pro creates user accounts, tracks usage, or collects analytics.
We do not sell or share user data with advertisers.
</p>

<p><strong>Neither app does the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Store prompts, images, documents, or voice data on our servers</li>
    <li>Store API keys on our servers</li>
    <li>Track users across apps or websites</li>
    <li>Include advertising or analytics SDKs</li>
</ul>

<h2>8. Third-Party Data Handling</h2>

<p>
While we do not retain your content, third-party AI providers may process or retain data
according to their own privacy policies:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Groq:</strong> https://groq.com/privacy-policy/</li>
    <li><strong>Replicate:</strong> https://replicate.com/privacy</li>
    <li><strong>xAI:</strong> https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy/</li>
    <li><strong>OpenRouter:</strong> https://openrouter.ai/privacy</li>
    <li><strong>OpenAI:</strong> https://openai.com/policies/row-privacy-policy/</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. Security</h2>

<p>
All network communication uses secure HTTPS connections.
Local data remains on your device unless transmitted to a selected AI provider.
</p>

<h2>10. Your Rights</h2>

<p>
Because we do not store personal data on our servers, there is no user data held by us
to access, export, or delete.
</p>

<h2>11. Subscription Management</h2>

<p>
LLM Pro subscriptions are managed entirely through Apple’s App Store.
We do not process or store payment information.
